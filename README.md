# rust-cryptopals
Rust implementation of the cryptopals set of challenges.

Includes a simple CLI tool to try out the implementations.

For the time being, I'm not going to work on more challenges. I'm currently getting more familliar with the Rust ecosystem, and want to easily be able to apply new concepts to a small project as I move forward. Once I'm through, I'll work more actively on more of these challenges.
